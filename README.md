# Learn-and-Code (Bariq)

Welcome to the **Learn-and-Code (Bariq)** repository. This project reflects my personal journey of learning programming and sharing notes and summaries along the way.

## Purpose

Through this repository, I aim to document everything I learn about technologies, tools, and challenges, along with the solutions I discover.  
I used to rely on notebooks for writing notes, but due to war and displacement, I had to leave them behind. This repository became my new space for keeping my knowledge safe and accessible, while also helping developers and programmers, especially those in Gaza.

- Summaries of technologies and tools.  
- Notes on obstacles and challenges faced by developers.

## Message

This repository is not just about programming. It’s a space to share human experiences, continuous learning, and strategies for overcoming challenges. It encourages others to keep moving forward, no matter the circumstances.
